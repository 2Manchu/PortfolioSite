CPRE 288: Embedded Systems I. The overall goal of this project was to develop code that would allow the group to navigate the vehicle (an iRobot Create 2) through a course entirely using onboard sensors, without the vehicle being directly visible to the group. As a whole, I learned a great deal about embedded systems and how they can be used to aggregate and process data from a variety of digital and analog sensors. I also learned about some of the workings of microcontrollers, including the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), general-purpose-input/output (GPIO), and how to handle hardware interrupts.

The microcontroller used in this project was a Texas Instruments TM4C123GH6PM, and the code base is written in C.

As this project was highly-team oriented, with all four members contributing ideas, it was very beneficial to my communication and time-management skills.
