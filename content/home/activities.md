<font size=5><strong>Cyclone Racing Formula SAE Team, Powertrain</strong> | <em>August 2021 - May 2024</em></font><br>
	The Cyclone Racing Formula SAE Team is a student-run organization whose goal is to create a Formula-style race car that can be entered into yearly competitions held by SAE International.
	Members must closely adhere to the guidelines set by the team's technical director, as well as the regulations imposed by Formula SAE's organizers in order to design a car that is competition-legal (Left: CR-26, Right: CR-27).

<font size=4><strong>FSAE Lead Tuning and Systems Engineer</strong> | <em>May 2022 - May 2024</em></font><br>
	For the 2022 and 2023 school year, I was elected to lead the development of the vehicle systems and tuning aspects of the car. This role involved designing and maintaining a complete electrical system for the car, including charging, power distribution,
	and wiring. I was also responsible for performing engine calibration, which relied on data analysis to ensure that we were extracting maximum power from the engine while remaining within safe operating limits.
	Being a part of this team provided me with valuable exposure to engineering principles, and experience working in a fast-paced collaborative environment.

<font size=5><strong>Freshmen Leaders in Engineering</strong> | <em>August 2020 - April 2021</em></font><br>
	ISU Freshmen Leaders in Engineering is an organization that aims to serve as a method of outreach to current and incoming
	freshmen regarding events and involvement at Iowa State. While we were very restricted in terms of activites as a result of the COVID pandemic,
	during my time as a member of this group, we planned and executed a fundraiser for the ISU food pantry, and also utilized 360-degree video capture
	technology to create orientation videos for prospective international students.

<font size=5><strong>WNHS ACES Academic Team</strong> | <em>January 2018 - May 2020</em></font><br>
	I was involved in my high school's engineering and science academics team from my sophomore year to the end of my senior year. Every member was responsible for studying two
	subjects that they would subsequently be tested on across several competitions later in the year. We placed first as a team at the regional event in
	2019 and 2020, and placed second at the sectional event in 2019. As an individual, I placed first in the subject of engineering graphics at the 2019
	regional event, and came third in the same in 2018 and 2020.

<font size=5><strong>WNHS Band Section Leader</strong> | <em>August 2019 - May 2020</em></font><br>
	As trumpet section leader in my high school's top band, I was responsible for acquainting newcomers with the marching band program, as well as
	planning some of the choreography for the fall 2019 season. I also collaborated with other section leaders to coordinate activities and build
	relationships between all members of the band.
