<font size=5><strong>Cyclone Racing SAE Formula Team</strong> | <em>Aug 2021 - Present</em></font><br>
	The Cyclone Racing SAE Formula Team is a student-run organization whose goal is to create a Formula-style race car (see top two images on the 
	left) that can be entered into yearly competitions held by SAE International. Members must closely adhere to the guidelines set by the team's 
	technical director, as well as the regulations imposed by Formula SAE's organizers in order to design a car that is competition-legal. I am a 
	member of the Powertrain subsystem, where I am working with our Tuning and Systems Engineer to develop a tune for the new engine that we are 
	using in this year's design. Being a part of this team has provided me with valuable exposure to engineering principles, and experience 
	working in a fast-paced collaborative environment.
	
<font size=5><strong>Freshmen Leaders in Engineering</strong> | <em>Aug 2020 - Apr 2021</em></font><br>
	ISU Freshmen Leaders in Engineering is an organization that aims to serve as a method of outreach to current and incoming freshmen regarding
	events and involvement at Iowa State. While we were very restricted in terms of activites as a result of the COVID pandemic, during my time as a
	member of this group, we planned and executed a fundraiser for the ISU food pantry, and also utilized 360-degree video capture technology to
	create orientation videos for prospective international students.
	
<font size=5><strong>WNHS ACES Academic Team</strong> | <em>Jan 2018 - May 2020</em></font><br>
	I was involved in my high school's engineering and science academics team from my sophomore year to the end of my senior year. Every member was responsible for studying two
	subjects that they would subsequently be tested on across several competitions later in the year. We placed first as a team at the regional event in
	2019 and 2020, and placed second at the sectional event in 2019. As an individual, I placed first in the subject of engineering graphics at the 2019
	regional event, and came third in the same in 2018 and 2020.
	
<font size=5><strong>WNHS Band Section Leader</strong> | <em>Aug 2019 - May 2020</em></font><br>
	As trumpet section leader in my high school's top band, I was responsible for acquainting newcomers with the marching band program, as well as
	planning some of the choreography for the fall 2019 season. I also collaborated with other section leaders to coordinate activities and build
	relationships between all members of the band.
