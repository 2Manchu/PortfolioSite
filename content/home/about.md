Hi, I'm Anthony Manschula. I'm currently a 4th-year undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, with a focus on digital design and verification. I have completed two internships with Western Digital, working as a digital verification engineer on the processor team, and one at Infineon Technologies, doing a mix of analog and digital verification and some digital design. When classes are in session, I work as an IT technician supporting the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Through my classes and work experience, I have knowledge of SystemVerilog and VHDL, UVM, and ARM AMBA protocols. I have worked closely with verification environments incorporating ARM Cortex R8 and M0+ CPUs, and collaborated with team leads to write functional and code coverage in order to close testbench milestones. In addition, I have experience with Cadence tools in both a digital and analog context, from debugging and fixing RTL design issues to creating and simulating pure analog testbenches. I am also familiar with other object-oriented languages, such as Java and C++.

I have had the opportunity for leadership both in high school, as section leader in the band, and at ISU, with my involvement in the Formula SAE team, as well as Freshmen Leaders in Engineering. All of these experiences have allowed me to leverage my communication skills, and pushed my development as a person.

Post-graduation, my goal is to pursue a position that will allow me to continue to utilize and build upon my digital design and verification skills.
