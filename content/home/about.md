Hi, I'm Anthony Manschula. I'm currently an ASIC Design Verification Engineer at ForwardEdge ASIC in St. Paul, Minnesota. In December 2024, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Iowa State University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. Along the way, I completed two internships with Western Digital, working as a digital verification engineer on the processor team, and one at Infineon Technologies, doing a mix of analog and digital verification and some digital design.

Through my classes and work experience, I have knowledge of SystemVerilog and VHDL, UVM, and ARM AMBA protocols. I have worked closely with verification environments incorporating ARM Cortex R8 and M0+ CPUs, and collaborated with team leads to write functional and code coverage in order to close testbench milestones. In addition, I have experience with Cadence tools in both a digital and analog context, from debugging and fixing RTL design issues to creating and simulating pure analog testbenches. I am also familiar with other object-oriented languages, such as Java, Python, and C++.
