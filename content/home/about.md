Hi, I'm Anthony Manschula. I'm currently a junior studying Computer Engineering, with a focus on VLSI Design, at Iowa State University. At the moment, I'm working on a co-op at Western Digital, where I am a part of the HDD CPU team. When classes are in session, I work as an IT Technician supporting the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and I also participate in the Formula SAE team we have on campus.

I am comfortable with object-oriented programming languages such as Java, as well as Linux environments and Bash scripting. Through my classes and work experience, I also have knowledge of PLD design software, Verilog/SystemVerilog, UVM, and ARM AXI and AHB protocols.

I have had the opportunity for leadership both in high school, as section leader in the band, and at ISU, with my involvement in the Formula SAE team, as well as Freshmen Leaders in Engineering. All of these experiences have allowed me to leverage my communication skills, and pushed my development as a person.
