Hi, I'm Anthony Manschula. I'm currently a 4th-year undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, with a focus on computer architecture and digital design. I have interned twice at Western Digital, where I was as a part of the HDD CPU team. When classes are in session, I work as an IT Technician supporting the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and I also participate in the Formula SAE team we have on campus.

Through my classes and work experience, I have knowledge of Verilog/SystemVerilog hardware description languages, UVM, and ARM AMBA protocols. I have worked closely with verification environments incorporating ARM Cortex R8 and M0+ CPUs, and collaborated with team leads to write functional and code coverage in order to close testbench milestones. In addition, I have experience with using Cadence Xcelium Waveform Analysis tools to debug and fix RTL design issues discovered as a result of my verification. I am also familiar with other object-oriented languages, such as Java.

I have had the opportunity for leadership both in high school, as section leader in the band, and at ISU, with my involvement in the Formula SAE team, as well as Freshmen Leaders in Engineering. All of these experiences have allowed me to leverage my communication skills, and pushed my development as a person.

Post-graduation, my goal is to pursue employment in a field that will allow me to leverage and continue to build upon my computer architecture and design skills.
