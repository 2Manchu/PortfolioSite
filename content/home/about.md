Hi, I'm Anthony Manschula. I'm currently a sophomore studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. There are several "focus areas" that one can choose to specialize in within the ISU Electrical/CPRE Department, and I'm currently planning on specializing in either Network Engineering or VLSI Design. When classes are in session, I work as an IT Technician supporting the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and I also participate in the Formula SAE team we have on campus.

I have had the opportunity for leadership both in high school, as section leader in the band, and at ISU, as a member of Freshmen Leaders in Engineering. Both of these experiences have allowed me to leverage my communication skills, and pushed my development as a person.
