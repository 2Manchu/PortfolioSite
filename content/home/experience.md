	<font size=5><strong>HDD SoC Development Engineer Co-Op</strong> | <em>May 2022 - Present</em></font><br>
	<font size=4>Through working at Western Digital, I have been able to greatly strengthen my understanding of Verilog and SystemVerilog. In addition, I gained knowledge on a number of critical subjects,
	including Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), ARM AXI and AHB protocols, and caching policies. Among some other projects, I mainly created and debugged SV/UVM testbench components that allowed further
	verification of the current SoC revision. I developed system arbitration UVM performance
	tests that allowed us to extract and analyze performance and latency data when communicating from each CPU core to other regions of the SoC, and applied knowledge of the AHB and AXI protocols
	to create UVM scoreboard setups for several other design components. As a whole, my experience at Western Digital has significantly improved my understanding of CPU subsystems on embedded hardware.</font>
