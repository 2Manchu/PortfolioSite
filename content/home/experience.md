	<font size=5><strong>HDD SoC Development Engineer Intern</strong> | <em>May 2023 - August 2023</em></font><br>
	<font size=4>This was my second experience at Western Digital, returning to the CPU team for the summer of 2023. Again, my primary responsibilites were targeted at creating and debugging UVM testbench components to verify design features, and as such, I continued to hone my knowledge of SystemVerilog and UVM. 
	During my 3-month stint, I was focused primarily on the CPU DRAM datapath, as there were several new hardware features for the latest SoC revision that needed to be verified. 
	This time around, I was much more involved in digging deeper into the RTL to find design issues, as I had pre-existing knowledge of the design and how it worked, and also because I was able to apply waveform analysis skills I'd learned in my processor architecture class in the spring. 
	As a side effect of working on the CPU DRAM datapath, I also learned about CPU memory virtualization and some of its workings and benefits from both a hardware implementation and a software architecture perspective. 
	In addition to these new experiences, I also maintained a few items I had developed during my previous co-op, and continued to collaborate with verification engineers to write effective functional coverage and close out testbench milestones.</font><br>

	<font size=4>During my first experience working at Western Digital, I was able to greatly strengthen my understanding of SystemVerilog. In addition, I gained knowledge on a number of critical subjects,
	including Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), ARM AMBA protocols, and improved my comprehension of object-oriented concepts. Among some other projects, I mainly created and debugged SV/UVM testbench components that allowed further
	verification of the current SoC revision. I developed system arbitration UVM performance tests that allowed for extraction and analysis of performance and latency data for various CPU datapaths, and applied knowledge of AMBA protocols
	to create UVM scoreboard setups for several other design components. I also developed a unit-simulation for a critical piece of DRAM datapath IP, which involved creating a SystemVerilog testbench for the IP, as well as an accompanying suite
	of tests to hit corner-cases not generally seen in the top-level environment.  In addition, I wrote functional and code coverage in order to close on testbench milestones, and I worked with a subset of the testbench that allowed for firmware-like C-code to be loaded and tested on the design.
	As a whole, my first experience working at Western Digital significantly improved my understanding of CPU subsystems on embedded hardware.</font>
