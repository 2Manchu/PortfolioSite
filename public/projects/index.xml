      <description>Cyclone Racing Formula SAE Team. As mentioned in the above section, I am a member of ISU&amp;rsquo;s FSAE team, and I have been involved with the Powertrain subsystem since August 2021. CR-26 is the car that we designed and built for the 2021-2022 school year, and although I was still a new member at the time, I contributed to several key areas within the Powertrain subsystem, including designing an updated wiring diagram for the car, and assisting with wiring and engine calibration.</description>

      <description>CPRE 288: Embedded Systems I. The overall goal of this project was to develop code that would allow the group to navigate the vehicle (an iRobot Create 2) through a course entirely using onboard sensors, without the vehicle being directly visible to the group. As a whole, I learned a great deal about embedded systems and how they can be used to aggregate and process data from a variety of digital and analog sensors.</description>
