                        <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Anthony Manschula. I&rsquo;m currently a 3rd-year student studying Computer Engineering, with a focus on VLSI Design, at Iowa State University, and I have interned twice at Western Digital, where I was as a part of the HDD CPU team. When classes are in session, I work as an IT Technician supporting the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and I also participate in the Formula SAE team we have on campus.</p>
<p>Through my classes and work experience, I have knowledge of Verilog/SystemVerilog hardware description languages, UVM, and ARM AMBA protocols. I have worked closely with verification environments incorporating ARM Cortex R8 and M0+ CPUs, and collaborated with team leads to write functional and code coverage in order to close testbench milestones. In addition, I have experience with using Cadence Xcelium Waveform Analysis tools to debug and fix RTL design issues discovered as a result of my verification. I am also familiar with other object-oriented languages, such as Java.</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity for leadership both in high school, as section leader in the band, and at ISU, with my involvement in the Formula SAE team, as well as Freshmen Leaders in Engineering. All of these experiences have allowed me to leverage my communication skills, and pushed my development as a person.</p>

	<font size=5><strong>HDD SoC Development Engineer Intern</strong> | <em>May 2023 - August 2023</em></font><br>
	<font size=4>This was my second experience at Western Digital, returning to the CPU team for the summer of 2023. Again, my primary responsibilites were targeted at creating and debugging UVM testbench components to verify design features, and as such, I continued to hone my knowledge of SystemVerilog and UVM. 
	During my 3-month stint, I was focused primarily on the CPU DRAM datapath, as there were several new hardware features for the latest SoC revision that needed to be verified. 
	This time around, I was much more involved in digging deeper into the RTL to find design issues, as I had pre-existing knowledge of the design and how it worked, and also because I was able to apply waveform analysis skills I'd learned in my processor architecture class in the spring. 
	As a side effect of working on the CPU DRAM datapath, I also learned about CPU memory virtualization and some of its workings and benefits from both a hardware implementation and a software architecture perspective. 
	In addition to these new experiences, I also maintained a few items I had developed during my previous co-op, and continued to collaborate with verification engineers to write effective functional coverage and close out testbench milestones.</font><br>
	<font size=5><strong>HDD SoC Development Engineer Co-Op</strong> | <em>May 2022 - December 2022</em></font><br>
	<font size=4>During my first experience working at Western Digital, I was able to greatly strengthen my understanding of SystemVerilog. In addition, I gained knowledge on a number of critical subjects,
	including Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), ARM AMBA protocols, and improved my comprehension of object-oriented concepts. Among some other projects, I mainly created and debugged SV/UVM testbench components that allowed further
	verification of the current SoC revision. I developed system arbitration UVM performance tests that allowed for extraction and analysis of performance and latency data for various CPU datapaths, and applied knowledge of AMBA protocols
	to create UVM scoreboard setups for several other design components. I also developed a unit-simulation for a critical piece of DRAM datapath IP, which involved creating a SystemVerilog testbench for the IP, as well as an accompanying suite
	of tests to hit corner-cases not generally seen in the top-level environment.  In addition, I wrote functional and code coverage in order to close on testbench milestones, and I worked with a subset of the testbench that allowed for firmware-like C-code to be loaded and tested on the design.
	As a whole, my first experience working at Western Digital significantly improved my understanding of CPU subsystems on embedded hardware.</font>

<p><font size=5><strong>Freshmen Leaders in Engineering</strong> | <em>August 2020 - April 2021</em></font><br>
ISU Freshmen Leaders in Engineering is an organization that aims to serve as a method of outreach to current and incoming
freshmen regarding events and involvement at Iowa State. While we were very restricted in terms of activites as a result of the COVID pandemic,
during my time as a member of this group, we planned and executed a fundraiser for the ISU food pantry, and also utilized 360-degree video capture
technology to create orientation videos for prospective international students.</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>WNHS ACES Academic Team</strong> | <em>January 2018 - May 2020</em></font><br>
I was involved in my high school&rsquo;s engineering and science academics team from my sophomore year to the end of my senior year. Every member was responsible for studying two
subjects that they would subsequently be tested on across several competitions later in the year. We placed first as a team at the regional event in
2019 and 2020, and placed second at the sectional event in 2019. As an individual, I placed first in the subject of engineering graphics at the 2019
regional event, and came third in the same in 2018 and 2020.</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>WNHS Band Section Leader</strong> | <em>August 2019 - May 2020</em></font><br>

                <p>CPRE 381: Computer Organization and Assembly Level Programming. This project as a whole spanned several months, from February until the end of the semester, with the overall goal of designing several processors around the MIPS ISA with the final goal of comparing their performance. It relied heavily on applying concepts from class, including VHDL skills, piplining, hazard avoidance, and general knowledge of digital logic and the MIPS ISA. All designs included in the below repository implement the core MIPS ISA, and will run an arbitrary MIPS assembly program (examples included). This project greatly enhanced my understanding of the process of debugging and fixing design issues, which I was introduced to in my first co-op at Western Digital the months prior. This project also familiarized me with the concept of design synthesis, and how different design strategies impact the critical path, and therefore the maximum theoretical clock speed of the processor.</p>

                <p>Cyclone Racing Formula SAE Team. As mentioned in the above section, I am a member of ISU&rsquo;s FSAE team, and I have been involved with the Powertrain subsystem since August 2021. CR-26 is the car that we designed and built for the 2021-2022 school year, and although I was still a new member at the time, I contributed to several key areas within the Powertrain subsystem, including designing an updated wiring diagram for the car, and assisting with wiring and engine calibration.</p>
<p>Although this was a new environment for me, I felt the opportunity to gain some skills not directly related to my major was important and that I should pursue it. Ultimately, I ended up with lots of exposure to a fast-paced, team-based environment, as well as experience with 2D and 3D CAD programs, and hands-on wiring and engine tuning.</p>
<p>To expand on a couple of the above points, having a wiring diagram is critical in this application. Since the car&rsquo;s electrical system combines many standalone components into one system, it is important that we can map out how each component should be wired, and how the components interact with others. Having this diagram helped me estimate an average load case on the electrical system so that we knew the current draw of our system would not exceed the engine&rsquo;s maximum generating capacity.</p>
<p>I also assisted the Lead Systems Engineer with engine calibration (image two shows the interface for adjusting some engine parameters). This consisted of monitoring engine data as it ran, making changes to engine settings to ensure safer and more efficient running, and doing post-run data analysis to adjust any settings that may have been missed in real-time.</p>

                <p>CPRE 288: Embedded Systems I. The overall goal of this project was to develop code that would allow the group to navigate the vehicle (an iRobot Create 2) through a course entirely using onboard sensors, without the vehicle being directly visible to the group. As a whole, I learned a great deal about embedded systems and how they can be used to aggregate and process data from a variety of digital and analog sensors. I also learned about some of the workings of microcontrollers, including the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), general-purpose-input/output (GPIO), and how to handle hardware interrupts.</p>
<p>The microcontroller used in this project was a Texas Instruments TM4C123GH6PM, and the code base is written in C.</p>
<p>As this project was highly-team oriented, with all four members contributing ideas, it was very beneficial to my communication and time-management skills.</p>
