                        <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Anthony Manschula. I&rsquo;m currently a sophomore studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. There are several &ldquo;focus areas&rdquo; that one can choose to specialize in within the ISU Electrical/CPRE Department, and I&rsquo;m currently planning on specializing in either Network Engineering or VLSI Design. When classes are in session, I work as an IT Technician supporting the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and I also participate in the Formula SAE team we have on campus.</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity for leadership both in high school, as section leader in the band, and at ISU, as a member of Freshmen Leaders in Engineering. Both of these experiences have allowed me to leverage my communication skills, and pushed my development as a person.</p>
<p>I am comfortable with object-oriented programming languages such as Java, as well as Linux environments and Bash scripting, and I also have knowledge of PLD design software and Verilog HDL.</p>

The Cyclone Racing SAE Formula Team is a student-run organization whose goal is to create a Formula-style race car (see top two images on the
left) that can be entered into yearly competitions held by SAE International. Members must closely adhere to the guidelines set by the team&rsquo;s
technical director, as well as the regulations imposed by Formula SAE&rsquo;s organizers in order to design a car that is competition-legal. I am a
member of the Powertrain subsystem, where I am working with our Tuning and Systems Engineer to develop a tune for the new engine that we are
using in this year&rsquo;s design. Being a part of this team has provided me with valuable exposure to engineering principles, and experience
working in a fast-paced collaborative environment.</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>Freshmen Leaders in Engineering</strong> | <em>Aug 2020 - Apr 2021</em></font><br>
ISU Freshmen Leaders in Engineering (bottom left image) is an organization that aims to serve as a method of outreach to current and incoming
freshmen regarding events and involvement at Iowa State. While we were very restricted in terms of activites as a result of the COVID pandemic,
during my time as a member of this group, we planned and executed a fundraiser for the ISU food pantry, and also utilized 360-degree video capture
technology to create orientation videos for prospective international students.</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>WNHS ACES Academic Team</strong> | <em>Jan 2018 - May 2020</em></font><br>
I was involved in my high school&rsquo;s engineering and science academics team from my sophomore year to the end of my senior year. Every member was responsible for studying two
subjects that they would subsequently be tested on across several competitions later in the year. We placed first as a team at the regional event in
2019 and 2020, and placed second at the sectional event in 2019. As an individual, I placed first in the subject of engineering graphics at the 2019
regional event, and came third in the same in 2018 and 2020.</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>WNHS Band Section Leader</strong> | <em>Aug 2019 - May 2020</em></font><br>
As trumpet section leader in my high school&rsquo;s top band, I was responsible for acquainting newcomers with the marching band program, as well as
planning some of the choreography for the fall 2019 season. I also collaborated with other section leaders to coordinate activities and build
relationships between all members of the band.</p>
