                        <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Anthony Manschula. I&rsquo;m currently a 4th-year undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, with a focus on computer architecture and digital design. I have interned twice at Western Digital, where I was as a part of the HDD CPU team. When classes are in session, I work as an IT Technician supporting the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and I also participate in the Formula SAE team we have on campus.</p>
<p>Through my classes and work experience, I have knowledge of Verilog/SystemVerilog hardware description languages, UVM, and ARM AMBA protocols. I have worked closely with verification environments incorporating ARM Cortex R8 and M0+ CPUs, and collaborated with team leads to write functional and code coverage in order to close testbench milestones. In addition, I have experience with using Cadence Xcelium Waveform Analysis tools to debug and fix RTL design issues discovered as a result of my verification. I am also familiar with other object-oriented languages, such as Java.</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity for leadership both in high school, as section leader in the band, and at ISU, with my involvement in the Formula SAE team, as well as Freshmen Leaders in Engineering. All of these experiences have allowed me to leverage my communication skills, and pushed my development as a person.</p>
<p>Post-graduation, my goal is to pursue employment in a field that will allow me to leverage and continue to build upon my computer architecture and design skills.</p>

	<font size=5><strong>HDD SoC Development Engineer Intern</strong> | <em>May 2023 - August 2023</em></font><br>
	<font size=4>This was my second experience at Western Digital, returning to the CPU team for the summer of 2023. Again, my primary responsibilites were targeted at creating and debugging UVM testbench components to verify design features, and as such, I continued to hone my knowledge of SystemVerilog and UVM. 
	During my 3-month stint, I was focused primarily on the CPU DRAM datapath, as there were several new hardware features for the latest SoC revision that needed to be verified. 
	This time around, I was much more involved in digging deeper into the RTL to find design issues, as I had pre-existing knowledge of the design and how it worked, and also because I was able to apply waveform analysis skills I'd learned in my processor architecture class in the spring. 
	As a side effect of working on the CPU DRAM datapath, I also learned about CPU memory virtualization and some of its workings and benefits from both a hardware implementation and a software architecture perspective. 
	In addition to these new experiences, I also maintained a few items I had developed during my previous co-op, and continued to collaborate with verification engineers to write effective functional coverage and close out testbench milestones.</font><br>
	<font size=5><strong>HDD SoC Development Engineer Co-Op</strong> | <em>May 2022 - December 2022</em></font><br>
	<font size=4>During my first experience working at Western Digital, I was able to greatly strengthen my understanding of SystemVerilog. In addition, I gained knowledge on a number of critical subjects,
	including Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), ARM AMBA protocols, and improved my comprehension of object-oriented concepts. Among some other projects, I mainly created and debugged SV/UVM testbench components that allowed further
	verification of the current SoC revision. I developed system arbitration UVM performance tests that allowed for extraction and analysis of performance and latency data for various CPU datapaths, and applied knowledge of AMBA protocols
	to create UVM scoreboard setups for several other design components. I also developed a unit-simulation for a critical piece of DRAM datapath IP, which involved creating a SystemVerilog testbench for the IP, as well as an accompanying suite
	of tests to hit corner-cases not generally seen in the top-level environment.  In addition, I wrote functional and code coverage in order to close on testbench milestones, and I worked with a subset of the testbench that allowed for firmware-like C-code to be loaded and tested on the design.
	As a whole, my first experience working at Western Digital significantly improved my understanding of CPU subsystems on embedded hardware.</font>

                <p>Iowa State CPRE senior design project, with Boeing as the client.</p>
<p>The aviation industry is adopting multicore systems to handle the demands of modern aviation technology. However, these systems can face interference issues that affect their performance, including the worst-case execution time for safety-critical tasks. To ensure the safety of avionics software, it&rsquo;s essential to examine and verify how interference impacts these systems. To address this, hardware and software providers are offering advanced partitioning technologies, allowing developers to allocate system resources effectively and minimize interference between applications running on separate processor cores. This project targets a specific ARM-based system-on-chip running the Xen hypervisor using both existing and custom-designed open-source tools to simulate interference scenarios provided by Boeing, aiming to enhance the robustness of avionics software on multicore architectures.</p>
<p>In this project, I have primarily acted as a project coordinator between the group and our contacts at Boeing, and contributed my knowledge of computer architecture to the selection of hardware and development of interference testing programs. As this project focuses heavily on our contribution to and usage of open-source software, a majority of the team&rsquo;s knowledge base was formed from the <a href="https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Main_Page">Xen Project Wiki</a> as well as exploration of various GitHub repositories relating to system stress and resource management.</p>

                <p>CPRE 381: Computer Organization and Assembly Level Programming. This project as a whole spanned several months, from February until the end of the semester, with the overall goal of designing several processors around the MIPS ISA with the final goal of comparing their performance. It relied heavily on applying concepts from class, including VHDL skills, piplining, hazard avoidance, and general knowledge of digital logic and the MIPS ISA. This project was completed in a team of two, with both members utilizing Git for version control. Due my partner&rsquo;s high workload that semester, I was primarily responsbile for the top-level design and integration of the processor, as well as unit testing as features were added. All designs included in the below repository implement the core MIPS ISA, and will run an arbitrary MIPS assembly program (examples included). This project greatly enhanced my understanding of the process of debugging and fixing design issues, which I was introduced to in my first co-op at Western Digital the months prior. This project also familiarized me with the concept of design synthesis, and how different design strategies impact the critical path, and therefore the maximum theoretical clock speed of the processor.</p>

                <p>Cyclone Racing Formula SAE Team. This car was designed and built for the 2023 Formula SAE North America competition. As this was my first year being the lead engineer for vehicle systems and tuning, it was quite a learning experience. While I was able to leverage some existing skills from the CR-26 car, considerable thought and planning was necessary to integrate all of the components in my system together in an effective and logical manner. This car required me to improve my knowledge of CAD programs including SolidWorks and AutoCad in order to claim space for my parts in our 3D model, as well as create a wiring diagram to assist us in wiring the car.</p>
<p>There were also several large changes to part selection, including an AiM Motorsports power distribution module, as well as a radically different air intake plenum. While the AiM PDM came with a learning curve and was a costly investment for the team, it proved invaluable by reducing wiring complexity from our previous mechanical fuse and relay block design, as well as providing current draw and output diagnostics for components such as water pumps and fans. The changes to the intake plenum design, while allowing for higher peak horsepower output, proved challenging during fuel map calibration due to the angle of the fuel injectors in relation to the intake runners. As some of the more complex aspects of tuning an engine were beyond my skill range at the time, I reached out to other Formula SAE teams, as well as local engine tuners in Ames for advice on dialing in settings.</p>
