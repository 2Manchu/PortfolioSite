                        <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Anthony Manschula. I&rsquo;m currently a junior studying Computer Engineering, with a focus on VLSI Design, at Iowa State University. At the moment, I&rsquo;m working on a co-op at Western Digital, where I am a part of the HDD CPU team. When classes are in session, I work as an IT Technician supporting the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and I also participate in the Formula SAE team we have on campus.</p>
<p>I am comfortable with object-oriented programming languages such as Java, as well as Linux environments and Bash scripting. Through my classes and work experience, I also have knowledge of PLD design software, Verilog/SystemVerilog, UVM, and ARM AXI and AHB protocols.</p>
<p>I have had the opportunity for leadership both in high school, as section leader in the band, and at ISU, with my involvement in the Formula SAE team, as well as Freshmen Leaders in Engineering. All of these experiences have allowed me to leverage my communication skills, and pushed my development as a person.</p>

	<font size=5><strong>HDD SoC Development Engineer Co-Op</strong> | <em>May 2022 - Present</em></font><br>
	<font size=4>Through working at Western Digital, I have been able to greatly strengthen my understanding of Verilog and SystemVerilog. In addition, I gained knowledge on a number of critical subjects,
	including Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), ARM AXI and AHB protocols, and caching policies. Among some other projects, I mainly created and debugged SV/UVM testbench components that allowed further
	verification of the current SoC revision. I developed system arbitration UVM performance
	tests that allowed us to extract and analyze performance and latency data when communicating from each CPU core to other regions of the SoC, and applied knowledge of the AHB and AXI protocols
	to create UVM scoreboard setups for several other design components. As a whole, my experience at Western Digital has significantly improved my understanding of CPU subsystems on embedded hardware.</font>

<p><font size=5><strong>Cyclone Racing Formula SAE Team, Powertrain</strong> | <em>Aug 2021 - Present</em></font><br>
The Cyclone Racing Formula SAE Team is a student-run organization whose goal is to create a Formula-style race car that can be entered into yearly competitions held by SAE International.
Members must closely adhere to the guidelines set by the team&rsquo;s technical director, as well as the regulations imposed by Formula SAE&rsquo;s organizers in order to design a car that is competition-legal.</p>
<p><font size=4><strong>FSAE Lead Tuning and Systems Engineer</strong> | <em>May 2022 - Present</em></font><br>
For the 2022 school year, I was elected to lead the vehicle systems and tuning aspects of the car. This role involves designing and maintaining a complete electrical system for the car, including charging, power distribution,
and wiring. I am also responsible for performing engine calibration, which relies on data analysis to ensure that we are extracting maximum power from the engine while remaining within safe operating limits.
Being a part of this team has provided me with valuable exposure to engineering principles, and experience working in a fast-paced collaborative environment.</p>

ISU Freshmen Leaders in Engineering is an organization that aims to serve as a method of outreach to current and incoming
freshmen regarding events and involvement at Iowa State. While we were very restricted in terms of activites as a result of the COVID pandemic,
during my time as a member of this group, we planned and executed a fundraiser for the ISU food pantry, and also utilized 360-degree video capture
technology to create orientation videos for prospective international students.</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>WNHS ACES Academic Team</strong> | <em>Jan 2018 - May 2020</em></font><br>
I was involved in my high school&rsquo;s engineering and science academics team from my sophomore year to the end of my senior year. Every member was responsible for studying two
subjects that they would subsequently be tested on across several competitions later in the year. We placed first as a team at the regional event in
2019 and 2020, and placed second at the sectional event in 2019. As an individual, I placed first in the subject of engineering graphics at the 2019
regional event, and came third in the same in 2018 and 2020.</p>
<p><font size=5><strong>WNHS Band Section Leader</strong> | <em>Aug 2019 - May 2020</em></font><br>
As trumpet section leader in my high school&rsquo;s top band, I was responsible for acquainting newcomers with the marching band program, as well as
planning some of the choreography for the fall 2019 season. I also collaborated with other section leaders to coordinate activities and build
relationships between all members of the band.</p>
